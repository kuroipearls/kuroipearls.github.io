Hi ! My name is Della. I'm a soon-to-be MSc (Master of Science) this July - August. Currently I'm studying in National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, department of electrical enginnering. My field of study are deep learning, computer vision, and image processing. I'm currently conducting a research in low-level vision (image restoration to be precise) using deep learning. I'm really passionate in this research, and also willing to improve myself as well as learning something new. 

Before I'm dwelling in my current research, previously I also worked on Natural Language Processing area (especially in Bahasa Indonesia since it's my native language) during my undergraduate's final project. At that time, I was doing a sentiment analysis regarding the local election.
