<p align="justify">Hi ! My name is Della. I'm a soon-to-be MSc (Master of Science) this July - August. Currently I'm studying in National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, department of electrical enginnering. My field of study are deep learning, computer vision, image processing. I'm currently conducting a research in low-level vision (image restoration to be precise) using deep learning. I'm really passionate in this research, and also willing to improve myself as well as learning something new. 
</p>

<p align="justify">Before dwelling in my current research, previously I also worked on Natural Language Processing area (especially in Bahasa Indonesia since it's my native language) during my undergraduate's final project. At that time, I was doing a sentiment analysis regarding the local election.
